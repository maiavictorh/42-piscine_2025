# 🧠 42 Piscine Projects in C

This repository contains my personal implementation of the **42 Piscine** projects using the **C programming language**. I'm working through these exercises on in the piscine to officially join **42Lisboa**.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of C
- Improve algorithmic thinking and logic
- Practice clean code and structured programming
- Become a student in 42Lisboa

## 📁 Folder Structure

I'm organizing the projects using a consistent naming pattern requested by the 42 norm:

```bash
.
├── C00/
│   ├── ex00/
│   │   └── ft_putchar.c
│   ├── ex01/
│   │   └── ft_print_alphabet.c
│   └── ...
├── C01/
│   ├── ex00/
│   │   └── ft_ft.c
│   └── ...
├── C02/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- `C--` refers to the project group (e.g., C00, C01, etc.)
- `ex--` refers to the specific exercise within the project
- `ft--` functions follow the 42 naming convention

## ⚙️ How to Compile

To test a file manually:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_function.c -o output
./output
```
